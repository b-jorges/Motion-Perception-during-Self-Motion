Pilots01.txt and Pilots02.txt stem from conducting the experiment in 2D in front of a computer screen. 
Pilots07.txt is from a subject whose performance was "all over the place"; some of the staircases did not 
converge at all and PEST velocities went up to several times the comparison velocity, while for other PESTs 
the PSE was roughly in the range of other subjecs (see also plots)
